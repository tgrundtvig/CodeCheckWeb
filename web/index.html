        <h1>Minimal Code Checker Prototype</h1>
        <div>This is a small 'proof of concept' code checking web server. The idea is that it should be able to auto-correct programming-assignments written by students.</div>
        <h3>WARNING: Work in progress.</h3>
        <div>This is only the very first prototype. There is no real security or even an administrative module yet. Users and assignments are inserted directly in the database using sql.</div>
        <h3>If you have been given an user account, you can try it out here:</h3>
        <div>Click <a href='/CodeCheckWeb/Login'>here</a> to login.</div>
